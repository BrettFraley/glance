npm WARN deprecated source-map-url@0.4.1: See https://github.com/lydell/source-map-url#deprecated

- From URL in warning:
Is npm bugging you about this module being deprecated? You are probably depending on this module via the source-map-resolve package, which is deprecated too.
If you are looking for a way to work with source map comments, try convert-source-map. This module is just a few wrapper functions around bad regexe
- RESULT: leave until other packages can be resolved as they may depend on this
